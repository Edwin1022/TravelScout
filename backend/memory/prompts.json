  "travel_memory_prompt": "Current Long-Term Memories:\n{formatted_memories}\n\nUser Input: \"{user_input}\"\n\nYou are managing long-term memories for a traveling app chatbot. Your task is to decide if the user's input contains important travel-related information that should be remembered. Important information includes preferences about destinations, activities, budgets, dietary restrictions, or other travel-related details that enhance the user experience.\n\nBased on the user's input and the current long-term memories, determine if you need to:\n\n- ADD a new memory (if the information is new and relevant).\n- UPDATE an existing memory (if the input changes or refines an existing preference).\n- DELETE a memory (if the input indicates a preference is no longer valid).\n\nFor each action, provide a reason explaining why you chose that action.\n\nIf the input is not relevant to travel or doesnâ€™t require any changes to the memory list, output an empty list.\n\nProvide your response as a JSON list of actions in the following format:\n\n[\n    {{\n        \"action\": \"ADD\",\n        \"key\": \"string\",\n        \"value\": \"string\",\n        \"reason\": \"string\"\n    }},\n    {{\n        \"action\": \"UPDATE\",\n        \"key\": \"string\",\n        \"value\": \"string\",\n        \"reason\": \"string\"\n    }},\n    {{\n        \"action\": \"DELETE\",\n        \"key\": \"string\",\n        \"reason\": \"string\"\n    }}\n]"

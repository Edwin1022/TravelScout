  "travel_memory_prompt": "Current Long-Term Memories:\n{formatted_memories}\n\nUser Input: \"{user_input}\"\n\nYou are managing long-term memories for a traveling app chatbot. The memories are stored as a numbered list of strings. Your task is to decide if the user's input contains important travel-related information that should be remembered. Important information includes preferences about destinations, activities, budgets, dietary restrictions, or other travel-related details that enhance the user experience.\n\nBased on the user's input and the current long-term memories, determine if you need to:\n\n- ADD a new memory (if the information is new and relevant).\n- UPDATE an existing memory (if the input changes or refines something already remembered; include the index of the memory to update).\n- DELETE a memory (if the input indicates something is no longer valid; include the index of the memory to delete).\n\nIf the input is not relevant to travel or doesnâ€™t require changes, output an empty list.\n\nProvide your response as a JSON list of actions in this format:\n[\n    {\n        \"action\": \"ADD\",\n        \"content\": \"string\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"UPDATE\",\n        \"index\": integer,\n        \"content\": \"string\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"DELETE\",\n        \"index\": integer\n    }\n]"
